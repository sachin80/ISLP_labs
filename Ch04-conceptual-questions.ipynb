    "    Training set: QDA will perform better on the training set since it's a more flexible approach and can better fit the training data.  QDA typically fits better because it estimates a separate covariance matrix for each class, giving it more flexibility and capacity to fit the training data—even noise. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Test set: On the test data, LDA is expected to perform better since the Bayes decision boundary is linear and ODA will overfit the data. LDA aligns with the data-generating process and avoids the extra variance in QDA that comes from estimating many parameters which leads to overfitting.\n",

    "    Training set: ODA will perform better on the training set since it's more flexible. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Test set: On the test data, QDA is expected to perform better since the Bayes decision boundary is non-linear and the number of training samples is large enough to estimate the class-specific covariance matrices accurately. However, if the training set is small, QDA may overfit, and LDA (which assumes a linear boundary and a shared covariance matrix) might generalize better despite its misspecified assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) \n",
    "    In general, as sample size $n$ increases, the test prediction accuracy of QDA relative to LDA improves. QDA is a more flexible model than LDA because it allows each class to have its own covariance matrix, enabling it to capture more complex (non-linear) decision boundaries. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of estimating more parameters, which leads to higher variance when $n$ is small. A $n$ increases, the variance of QDA decreases and if the Bayes decision bounday is non-linear, QDA will better approximate it as $n$ grows. But if the true boundary is linear, the performance gap between QDA and LDA gets smaller because the high variance that makes QDA bad at small $n$ diminishes with more data. \n",

    "    False: If the Bayes decision boundary is linear then the test error rate for QDA would not outperform LDA necessarily since the LDA model is correctly specified, such that it matches\n",

Therefore, LDa has lower variance, but slightly higher bias, wheras QDA has zero bias but higher variance and may overfit noise in finite smaples. So QDA typically has worse or similar test error unless $n$ is very large in which case they perform similary in asymptotically.  "

    "    Although 1-nearest neighbor reports a lower average error rate (18%) compared to logistic regression (20% training error, 30% test error), it’s likely overfitting. With $K = 1$, the model has very high variance it memorizes the training data and is extremely sensitive to small fluctuations or noise, which typically leads to poor performance on new observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Logistic regression, on the other hand, shows a **20% training error and 30% test error**. The fact that the test error is only moderately worse than the training error suggests that the model is not simply memorizing the training data it has learned a decision boundary that generalizes better. If the gap had been much larger, it would indicate overfitting; if the training error were very high, it would point to underfitting. But here, the balance implies a healthy bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since our goal is to minimize error on **unseen data**, and logistic regression appears more stable in this regard, it would be the better choice for classifying new observations in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Interview answer*:  I’d go with logistic regression. Even if the test errors are the same on this split, logistic regression is a lower-variance, parametric model and it’s more robust to small changes in the data and tends to generalize better, especially in noisy or low-sample settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In contrast, 1-NN has zero training error and very high variance, so it’s more prone to overfitting. Unless I had reason to believe the true decision boundary is highly non-linear and I had lots of clean data, logistic regression is the safer and more stable choice.\n"
